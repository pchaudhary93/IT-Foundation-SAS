Ans.  Two, 10, 20.


Q19. What is the total aggregated throughput for a Thunderbolt version 3 connection? Ans: 40 gigabits per second.


Q20. Thunderbolt signals can be set over both ______or _________ connections. 
Ans. Copper or fiber.


Q21. What is the maximum length of a Thunderbolt connection? 
Ans: If you’re using copper you have a maximum cable length of 3 meters, and if this is an optical or fiber connection, you’re running 60 meters in length.


Q22. How many Thunderbolt devices can be daisy-chained together? 
Ans: Six different devices.

Ans. Nine pin, 25 pin.


Q24. What type of connectors were used before the invention of the Universal Serial Bus? 
Ans: These were commonly used to send RS-232 signals which would allow us to send serial communication between our computer and other devices, such as a modem.
