Ans: If you start looking at power supplies that are used on computers, they’re often rated by the number of watts. A watt is a measurement of the real power used for that power system.


Q12. How would you calculate the number of watt used?
Ans. If you wanted to calculate the number of watts that would be used, you take the volts that are in use, multiply it by the number of amps, to have the total number of watts.


Q13. _______________ is the type of power that we are receiving from the outlet that’s in the wall. 
Ans. Alternating current or AC.


Q14. Why do we commonly distribute power using alternating current?
Ans. We’re commonly distributing power using alternating current because AC power can be sent over very long distances.

Ans: We often refer to the number of times this current alternates as the total number of cycles or hertz.


Q16. What is the frequency of alternating current in Europe?
Ans: You’ll commonly find 220 to 240 volts of alternating current coming from your wall outlet.


Q17.We often refer to the number of times this current alternates as a total number of _________________.
Ans. Cycles or hertz.


Q18. If alternating current is going into our power supply, then______________, is what is coming out of our power supply and onto the _________________.
Ans. Direct current, or Dc. Motherboard.


Q19. What is the voltage and frequency for a power supply in the US? 
Ans: It would be 120 volts of AC running at a 60-hertz frequency.


Q20. What is the voltage and frequency for a power supply in Europe? 
Ans: In Europe, 230 volts of AC running at 1 50-hertz frequency.


Q21. What should be done if a computer is moved from one country to another? 
Ans: Then we’ll want to be sure that the power supply is able to support these changes in voltage.


Q22. How can you determine the voltage of a wall outlet? 
Ans: You can use your multimeter and determine exactly what the voltage might be.


Q23. What should you be careful of when using a manually switched power supply? 
Ans: If you’re not using an auto-switching power supply, then you want to be very careful of what power source you’re connecting to.


Q24. What is the purpose of the switch on the back of the power supply? 
Ans: The power supply itself can automatically switch between 120 volt and 230 volts.


Q25. What is the power supply used for? 
Ans: This power that’s going into the power supply is now going to convert it to direct current.


Q26. What is direct voltage? 
Ans: The voltage is the difference in electrical potential as compared to the electrical ground.


Q27. What is a characteristic of direct voltage? 
Ans: Another characteristic of this direct voltage is that we specify it as either a positive value or a negative value.


Q28. What components typically require higher voltages? 
Ans: Higher voltages are commonly associated with components inside of your system that need additional power.


Q29. What voltage is usually used for modern motherboards? 
Ans: Modern motherboards are using 3.3V volts.


Q30. What components take advantage of the 3.3 volts on modern motherboards? 
Ans: M.2 slots, some RAM slots.


Q31. What is the Standby voltage used for? 
Ans: The standby is used when your system is in a hibernate mode.


Q32. What type of components use negative 12 volts?
Ans. Some older components on your system may use negative 12 volts for integrated local area network connections or some of the older serial ports that are in your system.


Q33. Are modern motherboards designed to use minus 5 volts?
Ans. Most modern motherboards won’t need minus 5 volts from the power supply.

Ans. 24-pin connector.


Q37. What type of connector is used in modern systems? 
Ans: Most modern systems will use this full 24 pins of motherboard power. 


Q38. How do you connect the power connector to the motherboard?

Q40. What type of devices may have multiple power supplies? 
Ans: If you’re working in a data center or with other servers, you may find devices that have multiple power supplies on the back.



Q41. How is the load shared between multiple power supplies? 
Ans: If one of these power supplies fails, the other power supply takes the entire electrical load of the system.


Q42. How do you remove a power supply from a server? 
Ans: They’re very hot-swappable. So, there’s a clip right on the top of this when you push down. And you can slide out the entire power supply and simply replace it with a new one without powering down the server.


Q43. What type of connectors are typically found on the side of a power supply that goes to the motherboard? 
Ans: A fixed set of connectors.


Q44. What is a modular power supply? 
Ans: Some power supplies are built to be modular. Instead of having a cable that is permanently attached to the power supply, you can decide exactly what you’ll plug in and use as few or as many connections as you might need.


Q45. How do you balance the maximum capacity of a power supply? 
Ans: You can certainly purchase a power supply that supports a very high number of watts.
