55_SAS_On 3D Printers
Self-Assessment Sheet


Q1. What is a 3D printer? 
Ans: A new style of printing that you might use is called a 3D printer that prints in three dimensions.


Q2. 3D printer that prints in ____________ dimensions. 
Ans. Three dimensions


Q3. We often refer to 3D printers as a ____________________.
Ans. Assistive manufacturing


Q4. What do we do to create a 3D model?
Ans. We’re creating layers upon layers to finally create the 3D model that you see in the final output.


Q5. What is additive manufacturing? 
Ans: Instead of starting with a piece of metal and grinding down that metal to create the final output, we’re using additive manufacturing.


Q6. What are 3D printers being used for? 
Ans: We are using these 3D printers around the world to be able to quickly create objects.


Q7. What is a very common type of 3D printing? 
Ans: A very common type of 3D printing is called filament printing.


Q8. What does FDM stand for?
Ans. Fused Deposition Modeling


Q9. Explain filament printing?
Ans. With filament printing, we are melting the filament and placing it in very file layers to create the 3D object.


Q10. What are the advantages of using this type of 3D printer? 
Ans: The advantage of a 3D printer is the print head will use the filament to print one layer on the object, move up a bit, print the next layer, and so on.


Q11. How does the filament printer create 3D objects? 
Ans.  The filament goes all the way to the top of the printer, where it connects with the printhead. And as it’s melted, it’s able to create the 3D object.


Q12. How does an SLA printer differ from a filament printer? 
Ans. The SLA printing tends to be smoother and more finely detailed than the filament printers.


Q13. What does an SLA printer stand for?
Ans. It stands for Stereolithography.


Q14. SLA Printer is often referred to as_____________.
Ans. Resin printer


Q15. How does SLA printers work?
Ans. This type of printer tends to work in reverse to what you just saw the filament printers. 


Q16. There’s __________that sits on the bottom of this SLA printer, and the object that you’re printing is attached to a ___________that moves up and down.
Ans. Liquid resin, build platform.


Q17. What is the biggest challenge with resin printing? 
Ans: The biggest challenge with resin printing tends to revolve around how you manage this liquid resin.


Q18. You have to use_______________, so that you don’t injure yourself when working with the resin.
Ans.  Protective gear


Q19. What should you do with leftover resin? 
Ans: If there’s any resin left over or any resin that you need to dispose of, then you have to take that to a hazardous materials facility in your area.


Q20. What do we refer to as the large surface used for 3D printing? 
Ans: We refer to this surface as a print bed.


Q21. _________________ is a flat surface, and it usually is either adhesive on the bottom with your filament printing or adhesive on the top, so that you’re able to connect it to the build platform with resin printing.
Ans. Print bed


Q22. What needs to be done to the print bed to ensure a successful print? 
Ans: Everything on this print bed needs to be completely level, it needs to be clean, and anything that we’re printing on this needs to stay completely still during the printing process.


Q23. What is the print bed for filament printing? 
Ans:  With filament printing, this entire surface that is used to print on is what’s considered to be the print bed.


Q24. What is the print bed typically made of? 
Ans: Aluminum or steel.


Q25. Are there different options for print beds? 
Ans: There are a lot of different options for print beds, and you can find some that are very large and some that are more compact.


Q26. What is the print bed in resin printing? 
Ans:  The print bed is the very small area at the bottom of this printer where the light is able to harden the resin.
