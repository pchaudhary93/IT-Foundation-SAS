16_SAS On Assigning IP Addresses
Self-Assessment Sheet

1. How to assign IPv4 IP addresses for Private IP?
There may be times when your device is configured to obtain a DHCP address, but on your local network there’s no longer a DHCP server. In those situations your devices will be assigned an APIPA address. That stands for an Automatic Private IP Addressing Address. 

2. What is the process of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)?
This four step DORA process happens every time a device connects to the network and needs to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server. 

3. What is the result of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)?
A DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so that it can communicate with other IP networks. 

4. Features of Static IP address?
When a device is assigned a static IP address, the address does not change. 

5. Features of Dynamic IP address?
Most devices use dynamic IP addresses, which are assigned by the network when they connect and change over time.

6. What is Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA)?
APIPA is a feature of windows-based OSes- included since Windows 98 and Windows ME. It enables a DHCP client to automatically assign an IP address to itself when there’s no DHCP server available to perform that function. 

7. What is unicast addresses?
The unicast address specifies a single interface. A packet sent to a unicast address destination travels from one host to the destination host. 

8. What is multicast addresses?
Multicast is a great technology that enables a group of computers sharing a multicast address to communicate together.

9. What is anycast addresses?
Anycast also known as IP anycast, is an IP network addressing scheme that allows multiple servers to share the same IP address. 

10. What is BootP?
BootP allows a client to find its IP address and the name of a load file from a server on the network.
