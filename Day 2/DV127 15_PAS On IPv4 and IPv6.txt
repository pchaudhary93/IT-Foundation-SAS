15_SAS On IPv4 and IPv6
Self-Assessment Sheet

1. How many bits are in an IPv4 address?
32 bits

2. How many bits are in an IPv6 address?
128 bits

3. What are the first 64 bits in an IPv6 address?
The network component is the first 64 bits of the address and is used for routing. 

4. What are the second 64 bits in an IPv6 address?
The node component is the later 64 bits and is used to identify the address of the interface. 

5. What is the highest possible digit/number for each byte in an IPv4 address?
8 bits

6. What settings to check when troubleshooting IPv4?
Check the host’s default router settings against the router’s LAN interface configuration, for the IP address command. 

7. What is Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)?
DHCP is a network protocol that is used to configure network devices to communicate on an IP network.
 
8. What port does a device use to broadcast to DHCP server?
It is broadcasted widely across the network using the UDP port number 68. 

9. What port does DHCP server use to broadcast to a device?
Port 68

10. What is a subnet mask?
Subnet masks are used by the local device to determine what subnet it happens to be a part of. So it uses this to mask out the IP address, leaving only the host address at the end. 

11. What is default gateway?
If the device also needs to communicate outside of your local subnet, and most devices do, you’ll need to also assign a default gateway.
