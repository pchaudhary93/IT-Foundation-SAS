17. What is RFID?
It is a wireless technology that’s widely used is RFID or Radio Frequency identification. 

18. How does RFID work?
If you have an access badge that unlocks the door by holding it up to a sensor, it’s probably using RFID inside of that badge. And we even use RFID at home to keep track of our pets.
