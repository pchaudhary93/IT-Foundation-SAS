57_SAS_Cloud Characteristics 
Self-Assessment Sheet


Q1. What are internal clouds?
Ans. One way is to use an internal cloud. This means that you are creating resources on your own internal network that will be used for these  application deployments. 


Q2. What does building your own cloud means?
Ans. Building your own cloud means that you’ll need somewhere to put all of this equipment, so you’ll need to build out your own data center, you’ll need to have all of your own racks, and that’s where you will install all of the equipment for your internal cloud. 


Q3. What does using an external cloud mean?
Ans. If you’re using an external cloud, then you’re using time that might be on an Amazon, a Microsoft, or some other third-party cloud provider systems.


Q4. If you’re using an external cloud, then you’re using time that might be on an _____________________.?


Ans. Amazon, Microsoft.


Q5. The cost for this external cloud can vary based on the _____________
Ans. Provider


Q6. What is an external cloud? 
Ans: This means that you’re sharing resources that are available on this very large public cloud, and most of this is usually stored in the cloud providers data centers, usually multiple data centers around the world.


Q7. What type of cost is associated with an external cloud? 
Ans: The cost for this external cloud can vary based on the provider. 


Q8. Is there a low entry cost for an external cloud? 
Ans: Yes, there is a low entry cost, so anyone can take advantage of this platform because you don’t have to pay for anything until you use it.


Q9. What kind of cost do some platforms use? 
Ans: Some platforms like to give you a fixed cost for everything that you might be using.


Q10. What is an example of a non-metered cloud service? 
Ans: If you use platforms like Dropbox or Google Drive, you’re paying a flat fee every month, meaning that this is a non-metered cloud service.


Q11. What is one of the advantages of having a cloud-based application instance? 
Ans. One of the advantages of having a cloud-based application instance is that you’re able to create more instances as the load increases and decrease the number of instances as the load decreases.


Q12. What is rapid elasticity?
Ans. Rapid elasticity is referred to as flexibility. 


Q13. What does the cloud offer us? 
Ans: The cloud gives us a way to instantly create a much larger capacity all by using these built-in technologies that are in a cloud-based environment.


Q14. What does this statement mean “Cloud-based platforms also tend to be highly available”?
Ans. This means there is redundancy built into the cloud-based platform, so that if they lose power, they lose a server, or something happens with the infrastructure, there’s always a way to keep everything up and running, because they’ve already created a redundant environment.


Q15. What might happen if the power goes out at the data center? 
Ans: If they lose power, there might be a generator to keep the center running. 


Q16. What are some ways to provide redundancy in a data center? 
Ans: There are many ways to provide this type of redundancy, and every cloud provider has a different level of redundancy that they might offer. 


Q17. How can you ensure data remains in sync when deploying application instances to different cloud providers in different countries? 
Ans: Many cloud providers have different methods for file synchronization so that you can deploy many different instances whenever it might be in the world, but all of that data is synchronized between all of those different data centers.


Q18. What is Desktop as a Service? 
Ans: The applications that are running in this cloud-based service are running as a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure.


Q19. The applications that are running in this cloud-based service are running as a?
Ans. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure.


Q20. What does VDI stand for?
Ans. VDI stands for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure.


Q21. What do you need to access your desktop from anywhere? 
Ans: This means all you really need is a mouse, a keyboard, and a screen and you will have access to your desktop from anywhere in the world.


Q22. What are we most likely seeing on the tablet we are using to access this Windows desktop? 
Ans: Most of what we will see on the tablet that we’re using to access this Windows desktop is a screen share. You’re effectively getting a remote desktop view of that Windows environment.


Q23. How important is the network connection if we are using Desktop as a Service? 
Ans:  This means that the network connection will be incredibly important if you’re using Desktop as a Service, because everything is happening across the network.


Q24. What technology does Desktop as a Service use? 
Ans: This uses remote desktop technology. 


Q25. You need that _________________in order to take advantage of Desktop as a Service.
Ans. Network connection.


Q26. What are Amazon’s services called?
Ans.  Amazon’s services are called Workspaces.


Q27. How can one create a Windows workspace using Desktop as a Service? 
Ans: Amazon’s service is called Workspaces, and I clicked a few buttons and created a Windows workspace all by using Desktop as a Service.


Q28. What does Amazon’s Desktop as a service allow users?
Ans. This allows users to create a Windows workspace.
