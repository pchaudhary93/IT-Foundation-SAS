Q4. One thing that doesn’t seem to change much between motherboard versions, though, is the _______________.
Ans. Power connector.


Q5. How many sizes and types of motherboards are there? 
Ans: There are over 40 different sizes and types of motherboards.


Q6. Are motherboards generally compatible between cases? 
Ans: There are only two of three that are very popular, and generally, you’ll find motherboards that are relatively compatible between the different cases.


Q7. Can you fit a very large size motherboard in a desktop computer?
Ans. Yes, you can fit a very large size motherboard in a desktop computer.


Q8. What size of motherboards can you fit in a small form factor device? 
Ans: You can only fit the smallest of motherboards.


Q9. What should you consider when selecting a motherboard? 
Ans: You might select for a particular task and particular motherboard.


Q10. What type of motherboard is typically found in a desktop computer? 
Ans: The standard ATX is the motherboard that you’d most likely find in a desktop computer.


Q11. What is the size difference between a standard ATX motherboard and a Mini-ITX motherboard? 
Ans: The standard ATX has a lot of real estate, plenty of expansion slots, lots of memory, and there’s plenty of room inside of a desktop for this size of motherboard. The smaller system, though, may require a much smaller motherboard, and you can see this Mini-ITX motherboard is very different in size than the larger standard ATX.
