19_SAS ON VLANs and VPNs
Self-Assessment Sheet


* What is a LAN?
A Lan ia a Local Area Network. We commonly define this as a group of devices that are in the same broadcast domain. 


* Why might we want to segment a network into smaller pieces?

We might want to limit the number of broadcasts that might be on a network. So we might segment the network into smaller pieces. 

* What are the inefficiencies of using multiple switches for a LAN?

Powering two separate switches, and we’re managing the configurations on two separate switches are the inefficiencies of using multiple switches for LAN.
* What is VLAN?
A virtual local area network is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer.


* How does VLAN solve the inefficiencies of using multiple switches?
VLANs reduce the incidence of collisions and decrease the number of network resources wasted by acting as LAN segments.


* How can we make a LAN more efficient and cost-effective?
A router can be used to build LANs for wired and wireless devices if both Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections are enabled.


* How does VLAN provide separation between different networks?
A VLAN uses a switch to group several different computers into a virtual network.


* What are the advantages of using VLAN over multiple switches?
VLANs provide a number of advantages including ease of administration, confinement of broadcast domains, reduced network, and enforcement of security policies.


* How does using a single switch with VLANs help to manage and lower costs for a LAN?
Using a single switch with VLANs by separating it with VLAN1, VLAN2, and VLAN3 this make it easier to manage the network and keep cost lower. 


* What is a VPN and how does it work?
A technology that has become rather commonplace on our networks today is a VPN or a Virtual Private Network. This is usually a combination of software and hardware that allows us to securely send information across public networks such as the internet.


* Everything sent over a VPN connection is automatically encrypted, making it unreadable if intercepted by anyone in the middle.
Yes, if they happened to capture this information, they wouldn’t be able to see or understand anything in the conversation.


* What does a VPN look like on the desktop of an operating system?
When connected, the VPN connection name will display connected underneath it. 


* The user can connect and disconnect from the VPN using this interface and may also have options to configure the VPN connection settings?
Yes


* Are VPNs typically hardware or software-based?
Bothe it’s based on hardware and software.


* What is the advantage of using a VPN in a coffee shop?
It can stop people, software, and web browsers from gaining access to your connection.


* How does the VPN concentrator handle incoming and outgoing data?
It receives incoming data, de-encapsulating and decrypting the data. It encapsulates the outgoing network data into encrypted packets and then transmits the data through VPN tunnel. 


* Can VPN software be installed on operating systems?
Yes


* Most modern operating systems come included with some type of VPN client.
For example, Cisco’s AnyConnect, Pulse, Palo Alto Network’s GlobalProtect.



* What is a VPN concentrator?
VPN concentrators are used to connect many remote networks and clients to a central corporate network.


* The entire process of VPN data encryption happens behind the scenes and is automatic as soon as you enable the VPN software
